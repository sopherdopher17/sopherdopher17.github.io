	<hr>
<p>1989 was released in 2014, and it was the fifth album in her career. Some of the most popular songs on this album are Shake It Off, Blank Space, and Wildest Dreams. My personal favorite songs on 1989 are I Know Places, All You Had To Do Was Stay, and I Wish You Would. A notable ex included in this album is Harry Styles.
