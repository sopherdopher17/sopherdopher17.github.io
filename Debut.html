<p>Speak Now was released in 2006, and it was the first album in her career. Some of the most popular songs on this album are Our Song, Teardrops On My Guitar, and Picture To Burn. My personal favorite song on Debut is Should've Said No. The color teal is heavily associated with Debut, hence the teal colors featured on the album cover. Here are some signs that you are this album: </p>
