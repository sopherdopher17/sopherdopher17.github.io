	<hr>
<p>Evermore was released in 2020, and it was the ninth album in her career. Some of the most popular songs on this album are Champagne Problems, Willow, and Cowboy Like Me. My personal favorite songs on Evermore are Gold Rush, and Right Where You Left Me.  The color maroon is heavily associated with Evermore, hence her coat featured on the album cover. Here are some signs that you are this album: </p>
