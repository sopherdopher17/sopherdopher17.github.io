<p>Folklore was released in 2020, and it was the eighth album in her career. Some of the most popular songs on this album are Cardigan, Mirrorball, and August. My personal favorite songs on Folklore are The Last Great American Dynasty, My Tears Ricochet, and Exile.  The color grey is heavily associated with Folklore. Here are some signs that you are this album: </p>
