	<hr>
<p>Lover was released in 2019, and it was the seventh album in her career. Some of the most popular songs on this album are Me!, You Need To Calm Down, and The Man. My personal favorite songs on Lover are The Archer, Cruel Summer, and Afterglow. The color pink is heavily associated with Lover, hence the pink clouds featured on the album cover. Here are some signs that you are this album: </p>
