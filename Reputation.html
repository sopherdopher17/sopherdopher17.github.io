<center><h1>Reputation</h1></center>
	<hr>
<p>Reputation was released in 2017, and it was the sixth album in her career. This album was released as her comeback after disappearing for two years after the contreversy between her and Kanye West. Kanye used Taylor's name in one of his songs without her permission. His lyrics were offensive to her and attacked her career, so Taylor took to twitter to tell the world that he didn't have her permission. Then Kanye's (now ex) wife, Kim Kardashian, posted an illegally recorded call of Taylor giving him permission to use her name. This was later exposed to be a fake phone call, but it was too late. Taylor's name was dragged into the mud as the entire world attacked her character and her career. She was called a snake, monster, serial-dater, and many more hateful things. She hid away from the public eye until coming back strong with her Reputation album. She used their words to her own advantage, using snakes and newspapers as center pieces in her album advertising. This quickly became one of her most successful albums, and any contreversy regarding her reputation was squashed with her new attitude. She proved that she no longer cared about what they thought of her. Some of the most popular songs on this album are ...Ready For It?, Look What You Made Me Do, and Delicate. My personal favorite songs on Reputation are So It Goes, Dancing With Our Hands Tied, and Getaway Car. A notable ex included in this album is Tom Hiddleston. The colors silver and black are heavily associated with Reputation, hence the newspaper print featured on the album cover. Here are some signs that you are this album: </p>
