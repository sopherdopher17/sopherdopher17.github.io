	<hr>
<p>Speak Now was released in 2010, and it was the third album in her career. Some of the most popular songs on this album are Sparks Fly, Back To December, and Enchanted. My personal favorite songs on Speak Now are Long Live, Speak Now, and Haunted. Some notable exes included in this album are Joe Jonas, Taylor Lautner, and John Mayer. The color purple is heavily associated with Speak Now, hence the purple dress featured on the album cover. Here are some signs that you are this album: </p>
